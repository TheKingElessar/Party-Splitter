## Use
### Keybinds
`T` sends a message. It uses the currently selected `/shout` mode and message type.

`P` reloads the messages from the file in `mods`. This is useful if you want to make live changes to the messages.

`G` cycles through message types.

`B` toggles `/shout`.

All these can be changed like any other keybind (found at the bottom of the Controls menu).

### Messages
These are the preset messages loaded by default.

```
{
  "insults": [
    "Just go back to single-player. At least THERE you can play in Peaceful mode.",
    "Not even close.",
    "Hey, it's alright. Maybe someday you'll learn to left click.",
    "Wow... and I thought *I* was bad at the game. You're on a whole 'nother level.",
    "Seriously? Is that the best you can do? I'd rather fight kindergartners.",
    "I didn't realize Minecraft was used to train Stormtroopers!",
    "you fool. you absolute buffoon. you really thought you could challenge me in my own realm?",
    "What the jiminy crickets did you just flaming do to me, you little bozo? You\u0027re done, kiddo.",
    "You don't have to be a PhD candidate. It would just help if you knew how to play.",
    "where were u when player die ? i was in minceraft playing game when chat show. \"n00b is kill\"",
    "gg e-z",
    "You ruined my video game. I ruined your life.",
    "Bro you just got straight yeeted on",
    "Your aim was just a *little* off.",
    "L",
    "Hey, can you take this L real quick?"
  ],

  "encouragement": [
    "Nice job!",
    "That was impressive",
    "You go, girl!",
    "Good work!",
    "Dang, you're good at the game!"
  ],

  "reaction": [
    "Just as the founding fathers intended.",
    "God save the Queen.",
    "Sir this is a Wendy's",
    "Amazing. A natural Minecraft player in their natural habitat."
  ]
}
```

#### Custom Messages
Aside from the preset messages, *Trash Talk* has the ability to load user-defined messages if one wishes to add more or remove certain ones. All of this is done from the `TTMessages.json` file found in `.minecraft/mods/`. Most people's `.minecraft` directory is in `C:/Users/[Username]/AppData/Roaming/`.

To add messages, simply edit that file. Be sure the `JSON` formatting is correctâ€”there should be a comma after every message's last quotation mark, except for the last. You can verify the file's formatting using [this website](jsonlint.com/).

If you want to revert back to the old messages, simply delete the file. When the messages are reloaded (through the hotkey or through restarting the client) the file will be recreated with the preset messages.

Currently, all messages must be part of one of the preset categories. They must also be 93 characters or less, since that's Minecraft's 1.8.9 chat character limit (with room for "/shout").
