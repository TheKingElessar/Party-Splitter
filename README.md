# Party Splitter

## Baptism of Fire

On Hypixel, you can’t join a 2v2 duel as a party of four (unless you buy MVP++ and make a private game)—you have to split into two parties of two and challenge each other. This Minecraft mod is supposed to automate that entire process to make it faster and easier.

I first tried making this last May. I couldn't get it working, and eventually gave up. I recently decided to finish it, and I thought I should probably start fresh.

### Commands

`/psplit`: Split the party.

`/psplit reform`: Reform the party after you've split it.

`/psplit update`: Update the party list in case you suspect the mod doesn't have the most up-to-date record of it.

### Installation

This mod uses Minecraft Forge:

 - [Install Forge](https://apexminecrafthosting.com/how-to-install-forge-client-side/)

 - [Install Mods](https://apexminecrafthosting.com/how-to-install-mods-on-forge/)
 
This mod depends on functionality from my ChatCooldownManager mod [here](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/ChatCooldownManager/releases/tag/v1.1). You must have CCM installed for PartySplitter to work.
 
Simply drop the [`.jar` mod file](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/PartySplitter/releases/tag/v1.0) in your `mods/` directory, and you're off!
