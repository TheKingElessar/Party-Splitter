# Party Splitter

## Baptism of Fire

I first tried making this last May. I couldn't get it working, and eventually gave up. I recently decided to finish it, and I thought I should probably start fresh.

### Commands

`/psplit`: Split the party.

`/psplit reform`: Reform the party after you've split it.

`/psplit update`: Update the party list in case you suspect the mod doesn't have the most up-to-date record of it.
